### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lslightly.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying on USTC, China
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning basic computer science lessons, like Operating Systems Concepts, Computer Organization and Design, etc.

I just learn some basic programming skills and I am not so good at programming since I don't practise often(possibly because I'm always hurrying about my homework and my daily homework doesn't contain much about programming. OK, actually, I know I'm lazy)

I like try new skills that seems not so hard to get and some practical tools.

I think I'm a VIMer because I like the way VIM dealing with the text and when I edit, I just talk with the VIM program with no mouse but a keyborad.

I'm also a Linux green hand, using Ubuntu. Not so good at command line and know just a bit.

So, To Be Better, Always Change!
